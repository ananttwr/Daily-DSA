Count frequency of each element in the array on 3/4/25

Problem

Problem statement: Given an array, we have to find the number of occurrences of each element in the array.

Brute Force Solution - Run two for loop in arr for every item and count and add in dict maintain a visited dict also.

'''
#------------ M1 -------------------------------------
# TC of this Brute Force solution is O(N^2), SC = O(N)
